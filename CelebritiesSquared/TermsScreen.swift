        termsText.text = "Official Rules to Play\n\nCelebrities Squared Inc. is ‘Much More Than a Game’! We are a technology company that has taken the old school game show fun from the good old days and created the best 21st century game show by putting it into an App. Everyone enjoys seeing what their favorite Celebrity is up to, the new styles of clothing they are wearing and just that glimpse into their glitz and glam lives. We at Celebrities Squared Inc. have created a fun way to get to see what they are up to. Each time you enter into a Celebrities SquaredTM Contest you are going to be tested on your Celebrity knowledge. You also have a chance to win a unique prize as the top scorer of the contest played. HOW IT WORKS. Each Contest will show you 10 short video clips from our exclusive interview with a Celebrity. Each clip freezes just before the Celebrity gives the answer to a question. At the freeze point, you are shown multiple choice or true/false answers, along with a 10.000 countdown clock. The fastest possible answer a question is at 9.999 seconds left on the clock. If you answer the question correctly the time is recorded and the next video clip starts, following the same process until all ten questions/video clips have completed. You earn points by correctly answering a question. If you answer a question incorrectly you earn zero points. A leaderboard displays your score at the end of each Contest completed successfully. Player with the most points can win; the tie breaker is the fastest time. If that’s still a tie, the player who finished at the earliest date and time wins. All winners will be required to qualify further as described below. Each contest has a start and end date/time. We start most Contests at midnight (12:00am) and end them at 11:59pm. HOW TO KNOW THE ANSWERS TO A CONTEST. How good is your Celebrity skill? Once you have completed a Contest successfully you can view the leaderboard as often as choose. Your user profile area allows you not only to view the active Contest you have completed but also to access all Contests that have closed out during the previous 30 days. You will see a button for ‘Active Contest’ and ‘Past Contest’. You can click on Past Contest not only to show the players’ ranks and scores, but also to see the correct answers (revealed by clicking ‘Replay’). This shows the unedited video clips with the participating Celebrity completing the question with the correct answer. You can also go to www.CelebritiesSquared.com to view closed Contest answers, videos, and Contest winners. HOW TO ENTER A CONTEST. There are two Contest Lobbies to choose from. 1. VIP Contest Lobby 2. Daily Free Contest Lobby VIP Contest Lobby: This is our In-App Purchase Contest Lobby. You will purchase tokens using your credit card securely by adding it in the user profile area of the app. Each VIP Contest follows the same ‘clips and answers’ gameplay as in the Fundraiser Contests. You may choose to purchase more tokens and play a VIP Contest as many times as you like trying to better your score. Prizes are a Fan Experience with the winner of each contest winning the opportunity to meet or have a 1-on-1 FaceTime Chat with the Celebrity the details of each contest are highlighted in the description of each contest. Daily Free Contest Lobby: The Daily Free Contest Lobby is exactly what its name is: ‘FREE’ to play. No tokens needed. Each Contest follows the same type of great ‘clips and answers’ gameplay the as the VIP Contest. You may choose to play a Daily Free Contest as many times as you like trying to better your score. These prizes will be items of fun value such as a 1-on-1 FaceTime Chat, cool merchandise, tickets to a sporting events, concerts or musicals, or a gift card to restaurant, retailer or service provider. HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOU WON? You will receive a push notification that the Contest has closed. You can view in your user profile all active Contests you have entered and completed successfully. If you’re #1 at the top of leaderboard when the contest ends… WOO-HOOO! You will be contacted via email by a Celebrities Squared Inc. representative. You will then communicate via email and phone so we can gather the necessary information to get you your prize. You will need to sign an affidavit of eligibility, liability and, where legal, a publicity release and send it back to us within seven days of notification. We can also add, before you start play, other qualifications we want, such as a background check. Once this is done we confirm you as the winner. If you don’t get back to us, don’t sign one of the required forms, are unable to claim a Prize, don’t meet qualifications or pose a threat to Celebrities Squared, the Celebrity or Prize provider, you will not win and will not receive a prize or any substitution. We will in this instance disqualify that person and proceed to contact the second highest scorer of a Contest to award the Contest prize. Travel companions are also required to sign a liability/publicity release prior to issuance of a prize that allows a friend to accompany a prize winner. WHAT ARE THE RESTRICTIONS OR CONDITIONS ON A PRIZE? We describe each prize within the Contest, including the approximate retail value for that prize. Refer to the terms and conditions for more details we would like you to read. Some prizes have extra restrictions or conditions. We post these in the specific rules for that Contest. For all travel prizes, unless otherwise specified, you must travel on the dates allowed, all airfare is coach class and hotel accommodations are standard class. Any meetings with Celebrities are subject to security and background checks. For international travel, you are responsible to obtain all necessary travel authorizations, visas, or other documentation. All other expenses are your responsibility. Travel restrictions, conditions and limitations may apply. The prize value may vary depending on point of departure, travel dates and fare/rate fluctuations. And because stuff happens, we can’t be responsible for any cancellations, delays, diversions or substitutions, or any act or omission of any third person or acts of nature with respect to the trip. Lost or stolen tickets, travel vouchers or certificates or similar items once they are in your possession, will not be replaced. Winner and guest must travel on same itinerary. If you or your guest are, in our opinion, obnoxious, threatening, abusive, or harassing we can terminate the trip or prize, in whole or in part, and send you both home with no further compensation. Your guest must be of legal age of majority in his/her jurisdiction of residence, or your child or legal ward (unless otherwise approved by us). If you live within a one hundred (100) mile radius of the site where the prize is to be performed, we may provide ground transportation instead. We spend a lot of time thinking up the most amazing prizes possible, so prizes can’t be transferred or substituted, except that we can substitute a prize of equal or greater value. And you might not love taxes, but income taxes on the value of your prize are your responsibility and you have to pay them. We’ll give you an IRS W9 form. WINNER PROMOTION By accepting the prize, you agree that we can use your name, residential city, state and country, photograph, voice and/or other likeness and prize information to tell everyone how awesome the prize was. This means we can include you in advertising and trade and promotional materials for Celebrities Squared Inc., in any form of media (including media that’s not yet known), and that we can do so without any additional compensation.

Please note that we do not have access to the information these third parties may collect about your interests to deliver relevant advertising to you, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy. Third parties that may serve, track and analyze ads on our Services, and thereby may collect information about your online activities on such Services.

To opt out of information collection by NAI member companies, or to obtain information about the technologies they use or their own privacy policies, please visit the NAI consumer opt out page. Also, through the Digital Advertising Alliance (‘DAA’), several media and marketing associations have developed an industry self-regulatory program to give consumers a better understanding of and greater control over ads that are customized based on their online behavior across different Services. To learn more and make choices about interest-based ads from participating third parties, please visit the DAA consumer opt out page. In the UK, the Internet Advertising Bureau (‘IAB UK’) has developed Good Practice Principles for Online Behavioural Targeting. More information and an opt out page to manage online behavioral advertising preferences with IAB UK member companies are available at YourOnlineChoices.com. Please note that if you choose to opt out of having your information used to deliver advertisements tailored to your interests, you will continue to see advertisements on our Services, but these advertisements may not be as relevant to you. We also may receive information from third parties about you and your activities on other sites for the purpose of serving relevant advertisements to you on Services. This Services privacy policy does not cover the practices of third parties, including those that may disclose information to Services. Please note that we may share information about our users with advertisers so that they can measure the effectiveness of advertisements viewed on the Services. For example, we may tell advertisers the number of users who clicked on a particular advertisement. Except in the circumstances described in the ‘sharing’ section of our privacy policy, such as with your consent, this information will be anonymized or aggregated. These online advertising efforts across Services do not result in you seeing more advertisements, just more relevant advertising.
