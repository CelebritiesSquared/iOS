Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Technologies Cookies Cookies are small amounts of data that are stored in separate files within your computer's Internet browser. Cookies are accessed and recorded by the Sites you visit, and by the companies that show advertisements on Sites, so they can recognize the same browser navigating online. CSI Sites may use cookies for the following general purposes: To help us recognize your browser as a previous visitor and save and remember any preferences that may have been set while your browser was visiting one of our Sites. For example, if you register on a CSI Site, the Site may save your password, so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit. To help us customize the content and advertisements you are shown while visiting CSI Sites and potentially other Sites online. Please read about CSI online advertising to learn more about our efforts to show you relevant advertising. To help measure and research the effectiveness of our interactive online content, features, advertisements, and other communications. CSI Sites may also allow third parties to place their own cookies within your browser in order to serve you with relevant advertising online, to help us measure traffic and effectiveness as described above, to provide you with access to social media networks, functionality and services, and to allow us to conduct any surveys and research in which you agree to participate. Third parties that use cookies to help us with traffic measurement, research and analytics include Omniture, Comscore, Nielsen and ConfirmIT. Please note that we do not share contact information with these third parties. For more information about the use of cookies by third parties for advertising purposes, please read about third-party online advertising on CSI Sites.

For information about your choices in allowing cookies to be set, please see ‘Your Choices with respect to Cookies and Web Beacons’ at the end of this section. Web Beacons and Other Technologies We may use standard Internet technology, such as web beacons and similar technologies, to track your use of the CSI Sites. Web beacons (sometimes called transparent GIFs, clear GIFs, or web bugs) are small strings of code that provide a way for us to deliver a small graphic image (usually invisible) on a web page or in an email. Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on your computer such as cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, and a description of the page where the web beacon is placed. We use web beacons to improve your experience on our Sites, including to provide you with content customized to your interests and to understand whether users read email messages and click on links contained within those messages so that we can deliver relevant content and offers. Our web beacons may collect some contact information (for example, the email address associated with an email message that contains a web beacon). CSI Sites also may include third-party web beacons. These web beacons allow third party service providers to collect certain information such as your IP address, your browser type, and the web page that you visited before arriving at our Sites. These service providers process the information they collect for purposes of auditing, research, and reporting information about the CSI Sites and advertisements viewed on the CSI Sites.

Your Choices with respect to Cookies and Web Beacons You have the choice to set your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, notify you when a cookie is set, and to delete your cookies periodically. Each browser is different, so check the ‘Help’ menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. Web beacons are generally used in conjunction with cookies, so if your browser is set to reject cookies, or if cookies are deleted, web beacons will be unable to track your activity as you navigate between Sites. It is up to you whether to allow us or third parties to send you cookies, but if you block cookies, you may not be able to view or access some or all of a CSI Site. By using CSI Sites and by choosing not to block or disable cookies, web beacons or other similar technologies where you have the opportunity to do so, you consent to the uses of your personal information in relation to these technologies as described in this policy.
